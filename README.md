# Hospital Readmission Predictor

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict 30-day hospital readmission risk using patient demographic, clinical, and treatment data. We built and tuned machine learning models, with XGBoost performing best.

## Repository Structure
- `/data/`: Contains the cleaned dataset used for training and evaluation.
- `/notebook/predictor_model.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook covering data processing, exploratory analysis, modeling, evaluation, and explainability.
- `/docs/`: Documentation including the project proposal, results report, clinical insights, and dashboard design mockups.
- `/app/streamlit_app.py`: Streamlit app providing an interactive dashboard demo for risk prediction and explanation.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies needed to run the project.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
3. Launch the notebook to reproduce modeling and explainability results.
4. (Optional) Run the Streamlit app:
5. Explore `/docs/` for detailed reports and analysis.
